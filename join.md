PANDAS Lab is thrilled to work with motivated undergraduate and graduate students on our research projects. 
While funding is limited and not generally available, we are happy to offer **co-authorship opportunities**
and **research experience** working on cutting edge science.

While our PANDAS Lab principal investigators are currently professors in UNC Charlotte's Department of Political Science and Public Administration, we are privileged to work with collaborators from around the world. 

If you are interested in collaborating with our lab, reach out to us by
<a href="mailto:bradfor7+pandas@charlotte.edu">email</a> or contact us [here]({% link contact.md %}).
